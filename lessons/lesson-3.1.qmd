# Recap

## Time dilation

* If I'm watching a person move relative to me, whose clock do I perceive to run slower: mine or theirs?
* Whose clock do they perceive to run slower: mine or theirs?
* By what factor?
  * $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$

# Distance

## Relativistic length

* Unsurprisingly, if the passage of time changes for observers in relative motion, [and speed (of light) is distance divided by time,]{.fragment} [and the speed of light is constant for all observers,]{.fragment} [then distance should change too.]{.fragment}
* By how much?
* Say we wanted to measure the length of a train with _rest length_ $L$ whizzing by us at speed $v$. [What would we measure its length to be?]{.fragment}
  * Meaning that someone at rest with respect to the train perceives it as having length $L$.

::: {.notes}
For the speed of light to remain constant (with respect to a given frame), either neither or both of space and time must change. Our intuition says that the speed of light is constant with respect to a universal background frame, and neither space nor time change. But in reality the speed of light is constant with respect to each and every observer, and that leads to time changing, which requires that space change as well.

## Challenges

* Maybe I want to measure the train by running alongside it with a ruler or tape measure... [why wouldn't this work?]{.fragment}
* Your turn: devise a thought experiment _whose outcome we can already predict_ that will tell us the length of the train according to the platform observer.


::: {.notes}
This is a hard question and there's more than one right answer, although what I'm going to present is probably the simplest.

Remember the tools in our toolbox: light as a measuring stick, the concept of observers agreeing on events. And now, we also know about time dilation.

_Pause for a bit here and really let them think. If they want to use light as a measuring stick, they may need to think outside the box a bit._

## The method

* When the front of the train passes me, I start my stopwatch (light clock).
* When the back of the train passes me, I stop my stopwatch.
* Call the elapsed time (on _my_ watch) $\Delta t$.
* The train (in particular, the front of the train) was traveling at speed $v$ for $\Delta t$, so it traveled $v\Delta t$.
* And it's now exactly that distance from me, and I'm at the same spot as the back of the train, [so $v\Delta t$ is also the length of the train.]{.fragment}

## The method

* Suppose the train has a rest length of $L$.
* What will _we_ measure $\Delta t$ to be?
* Naively, we'd simply expect to measure $\Delta t=\frac{L}{v}$. [But, unsurprisingly, this is not the case.]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
Because the front of the train has traveled a distance of L when the back of the train reaches me, and it's traveling at v.
:::

## The method

* We'll have a person standing at the back of the train.
  * When I pass by the front of the train, they start their stopwatch.
  * When I pass by the back of the train, they stop their stopwatch and simultaneously record the time on my stopwatch.
  * Question: what will they see my stopwatch read?
  * Hint: to them, I'm speeding by at $v$.


## ⚠️ Major issue with this setup!

* How do they know when I pass by the front of the train? [They're not there when it happens!]{.fragment}

# Synchronization

## Events that happen elsewhere

* We need a way to talk about events that don't happen where we're located.
* Solution:
  * At each position, place an observer.
  * Make sure the observers are stationary relative to each other (i.e. are in the same frame).
  * Have them record the coordinates of their respective events.
  * Afterwards, they reconvene and discuss their findings.

## Events that happen elsewhere

* New problem: [they need to agree on a common coordinate system to make sense of their findings.]{.fragment}

## Synchronizing clocks

* Example:
  * You forget to update your clock after daylight savings, so yours reads 1pm when mine reads 2pm.
  * We go to see a movie together.
  * According to my watch, it started at 4pm.
  * According to your watch, it ended at 5pm.
  * How long was the movie? [Not one hour...]{.fragment}
* Takeaway: it only makes sense to compare readings of two clocks that are _synchronized_!

## The procedure

* Your turn: how can we synchronize the clocks of two observers stationary with respect to each other?
* The goal: a procedure that will ensure that two stationary observers located at different points in space (a known distance apart) have the same reading on their respective clocks.
* Hint: use light as a tool.


## One bad procedure

1. Alice starts with Clock A.
1. She walks it over to Bob, who's holding Clock B.
1. Bob sets B’s time to A’s.
1. Alice walks A back to its starting position.
1. Now Clocks A and B are at different positions and are in sync.

* _Why doesn't this work?_

::: {.notes}
An alternative to this is that maybe Alice and Bob meet in the middle, synchronize their clocks, then walk back to their starting points. This would work because by symmetry their clocks would dilate in the same way. But we'll see why this is less than ideal in a second.
:::

## Another bad procedure

1. Alice starts with Clock A.
1. She uses wifi (or radio or bluetooth or...) to transmit A’s current time to Bob.
1. Bob sets Clock B to the time given in the signal.

* _Why doesn't this work?_

::: {.notes}
Bob’s clock will be behind by the time it took the light to travel. So we have to take into account this travel time, which is what we'll do in our chosen method.
:::

## The procedure

1. Suppose the distance between Clocks A and B is $L$.
1. Alice sets Clock A to $0$, but doesn't start it yet.
1. Bob sets Clock B to $L/c$, but doesn't start it yet.
1. Alice emits a photon towards Bob, and at the same time starts her clock.
1. When Bob receives the photon, he starts his clock.

::: {.notes}
Importantly, this could be verified by a third party in the same frame and equidistant from the two clocks — they'd see the same time on both clocks.
:::

## The procedure

* Bob’s clock will read $L/c$ (that's what he'd set it to...)
* And it will take $L/c$ for the photon to arrive at Bob, so Alice’s clock will read $L/c$ as well.
* And so the two clocks are synchronized! [(And because they're in the same frame, they remain synchronized.)]{.fragment}


## Scaling up

* We can use this same method to synchronize an arbitrary (even an infinite) number of clocks.
* Each clock has its initial time set to $d/c$, where $d$ is its distance from Alice.
* Alice sends out a spherical pulse of light.
* Each clock is started when the pulse reaches it.
* So we can talk about the times of events at arbitrary points in space (in our reference frame)! [Just put an observer at the points, have them observe the events, and then reconvene afterwards.]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
If you remember this diagram from Lesson 1, it may not have even occurred to you to wonder how we got those clocks in sync in the first place, but it is an important problem that we have to solve.
:::

## Time of travel

* FAQ: when we record the time of a distant event, are we referring to when it “actually” happened or when we saw it happen? [The latter incurs a delay due to the time it takes light to reach us from the event.]{.fragment}
* Answer: when it “actually” happened. [We know how far away it is, so we know how long it took the light to reach us.]{.fragment}
* So whenever we talk about the time of an event, we're always talking about the time a stationary clock located there (and synced with us) would have read when the event occurred.

::: {.notes}
Let's say an event happens one light second away from me, and I observe its light reach me at t=5s. Then I know the event took place at t=4s.
