# Recap

## Key facts

* Light has the same speed for all observers, regardless of their relative motion
  * No “why” — experimentally confirmed, we just have to accept it
* An _event_ is a specification of time and place (in a given coordinate system)

## Key facts

* The same laws of physics hold in all _inertial reference frames_
  * In particular, no two observers can disagree on whether or not two events are the same (although they may disagree on the specific coordinates of those events)
  * And in general, observers agree on the “big picture” of the universe.

# Time dilation

## Light clocks

* Since light has a known speed, let's use it to measure the passage of time as follows:

_Bottom = play/reset. Top = pause_

One light second = 186k miles

## Light clocks

* How do we know that light clocks are just as valid as regular clocks? (Could a light clock become out of sync with a mechanical clock in the same frame?)
* Time is measured by clocks. [Light clocks are valid clocks.]{.fragment} [_Therefore we can, and will, use light clocks to measure time_.]{.fragment}
* _The time between two events — in our reference frame — is the number of round trips that a photon makes in a light clock in our reference._
* Why can't we count individual bounces — why do we have to count round trips?

::: {.notes}
1. Because an observer could hold a light clock and a regular clock stationary in their frame, and they'd remain in sync. That gives us events of the ticks. And events cannot differ between frames, so every observer would agree those two clocks are in sync.
1. Note that (light) clocks are not a phenomenon that happens separately from time — they are the thing that measures time, just as a ruler measures length. All physical processes can be tied back to a light clock.
1. Because we cannot be at the other mirror to observe the bounce — we can only observe events that happen where we are.

# Observers in motion

## Light clocks in motion

* Key features:
  * Time is measured by the number of round trips of the photon.
  * The number of round trips depends on the distance the photon travels.
* Question: [_what happens when a light clock is set in motion_?]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
Time seems discrete but is of course continuous — we can make arbitrarily precise light clocks by making the mirrors closer together

Remember: speed of light is constant

Instructions: start off at 0.0. Then go slowly, 0.1. Gradually increase.

Top pane top mirror resets, bottom pane bottom mirror starts, top pane bottom mirror shifts top

Who can describe what is happening here?

Why is that happening?
:::

## How much slower?

* How much more slowly does the moving clock tick off time?
  * It ticks off once every time it does an “up-down”.
  * How long does it take this photon to do an “up-down”?
    * Certainly more than a second, as it is “wasting” some of its velocity traveling sideways.

::: {.notes}
Again, how do we know that the photon in the bottom frame is traveling partially horizontally? (Because it has to hit the mirror again as it bounces, as observed by the moving observer.)

# Let's solve for $\Delta t'$!

##

$$
\begin{align}
  \Delta t&\class{fragment}{{} =\frac{2h}{c}}\\
  \class{fragment}{h}&\class{fragment}{{} =\frac{c\Delta t}{2}}\\\\
  \class{fragment}{\frac{c\Delta t'}{2}}&\class{fragment}{{} =\sqrt{h^2+\left(\frac{v\Delta t'}{2}\right)^2}}\\
  &\class{fragment}{{} =\sqrt{\frac{c^2\Delta t^2}{2^2}+\frac{v^2\Delta t'^2}{2^2}}}\\
  \class{fragment}{\frac{c^2\Delta t'^2}{2^2}}&\class{fragment}{{} =\frac{c^2\Delta t^2}{2^2}+\frac{v^2\Delta t'^2}{2^2}}
\end{align}
$$

##

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{c^2\Delta t'^2}{2^2}&=\frac{c^2\Delta t^2}{2^2}+\frac{v^2\Delta t'^2}{2^2}\\
\class{fragment}{c^2\Delta t'^2}&\class{fragment}{{}=c^2\Delta t^2+v^2\Delta t'^2}\\
\class{fragment}{(c^2-v^2)\Delta t'^2}&\class{fragment}{{}=c^2\Delta t^2}\\
\class{fragment}{\Delta t'^2}&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{c^2}{c^2-v^2}\Delta t^2}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{1}{1-(v/c)^2}\Delta t^2}\\
\class{fragment}{\Delta t'}&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\Delta t}\\
\end{align}
$$

## That constant...

* We are going to see $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$ _everywhere_.
* So, let's give it a name: [$\gamma$.]{.fragment}

## What we found today

* If two observers are given identical clocks, [and they are in relative motion,]{.fragment} [each will observe the other’s clock run slow]{.fragment} [by a factor of $\gamma$.]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
Important notes:

1. Each individual thinks their own clock ticks at the correct rate and thinks the other’s clock ticks slowly
1. This is about the rate of ticking, not a lag like time zones

## Some values of $\gamma$

* A fast car: $v=50\,\textrm{m/s}$, [$\gamma=1+1.40\times 10^{-14}$.]{.fragment}
* The Sun: $v=230\,\textrm{km/s}$, [$\gamma=1+2.94\times 10^{-7}$.]{.fragment}
* Now for some faster objects...
  * $v=0.1c$, $\gamma=1.005$
  * $v=0.5c$, $\gamma=1.15$
  * $v=0.9c$, $\gamma=2.29$
  * $v=0.99c$, $\gamma=7.09$
  * $v=0.999c$, $\gamma=22.37$
  * $v=0.9999c$, $\gamma=70.71$

## Some values of $\gamma$

## Exercises (5 minutes)

* Find $\gamma$ for $v=\frac{3}{5}c$.
* Find $\gamma$ for $v=\frac{4}{5}c$.

## For next time

* Make sure you're comfortable with everything we covered today, including:
  * The constancy of the speed of light
  * The “no privileged reference frames” argument
  * The derivation of $\gamma$
  * Feel free to work together!
* Ponder: How can I perceive your clock running slow while you perceive my clock running slow?

::: {.notes}
* Isn't this a contradiction?
* No — why not?
