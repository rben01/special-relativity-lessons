# Recap

## Basic findings

* $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$.
* Moving clocks run slow by a factor of $\gamma$.
* Moving objects are contracted by a factor of $\gamma$.
* Leading clocks lag by $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$.

## The Lorentz transform

* This can be encapsulated in the Lorentz transform (with $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$).

# Paradoxes

## The ‚Äúpole in barn‚Äù paradox

* A pole of rest length $L$ is moving to the right, along its length, at speed $v$.
* A barn of rest length $\frac{L}{\gamma}$ has its front door open and the back door closed.
	* The barn thinks the pole has length $\frac{L}{\gamma}$ too.
* The pole enters the barn through the front door.
* As soon as the barn thinks the pole is entirely inside the barn, the front door closes and the back door opens, and the pole continues on.

## The paradox

* According to the barn, the pole perfectly fits and flies through the barn with neither door being smashed by the pole.
* According to the pole, the barn _is too short for it to fit_:
	* The barn has length $\frac{L}{\gamma^2}<L$.
* How do we resolve this? [Does the pole fit or not?]{.fragment}

## The resolution

* This is a nonsensical question.
* The pole ‚Äúfitting‚Äù is a question of events at _different locations_: [whether both ends of the pole are inside of the barn _at the same time_ depends on whose clocks you're consulting!]{.fragment}
	* Remember, simultaneity is relative.
* But reference frames are only required to agree about events at _the same location_.

## The resolution

* The correct questions to ask:
	* Does the front of the pole just glance the back door of the barn?
	* Does the front door of the barn just glance the back of the pole?
	* Or, does the **back** door **open** so **late** that it collides with the pole? (Front/close/early.)
	* Or, does the **back** door **open** so **early** that it misses the pole entirely? (Front/close/late.)

## The resolution (barn perspective)

* The barn says no. Why does the pole also say no?
* The barn says that at $t=0$:
	* A clock at the back of the pole reads $t'=0$.
	* The barn closes the front door (at $x=0$).
	* The barn opens the back door (at $x=\frac{L}{\gamma}$).

## The resolution (pole perspective)

* The pole says that:
	* Leading clocks lag!
	* To the pole, the front door of the barn is leading.
	* Therefore it closes after the back door opens.

## The resolution (quantitative)

* Supposing the back of the pole is at $x'=0$ and the front at $x'=L$, then it observes:
	* The back door opens at $t'=\gamma(t-\frac{vx}{c^2})=-\frac{vL}{c^2}$.
	* The front door closes at $t'=0$ ‚Äî¬†some time later.

## The resolution (quantitative)

* And the position of the pole‚Äôs ends at those times is:
	* At $t'=0$, the back is at $x'=0$ (because the barn said so).
	* At $t'=-\frac{vL}{c^2}$, the front is at $x'=L+vt'=L(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})=\frac{L}{\gamma^2}$ ‚Äî¬†exactly the length of the barn (according to the pole)!

## The resolution

* While the pole does not believe it fits, that's fine.
* It only needs to fit if the doors open/close simultaneously ‚Äî¬†[but to the pole, they don't!]{.fragment}
* It agrees that its front end just kissed the back door of the barn, and its back end was just kissed by the front door of the barn.
* The barn says these happened at the same time ‚Äî the pole fits ‚Äî but the pole doesn't.
* And that's ok ‚Äî they agree on the _individual events_ at the front and back of the barn.

## The twin paradox

* Two twins are on Earth. They are (obviously) the same age.
* One twin heads off into space. They travel at high speed in one direction, turn around after a while, and return to Earth.
* Who is older: the Earth-bound twin (Ernie) or the astronaut twin (Alice)?

## The paradox

* Ernie has been observing Alice age more slowly for her whole trip.
* Alice has been observing Ernie age more slowly for her whole trip.
* When they reunite, they're in the same place at the same time ‚Äî [and they cannot each think they are older than the other.]{.fragment}
* They must actually be in agreement about their ages.

## The paradox (resolution, kinda)

* üö®‚ö†Ô∏èThe key word is ‚Äúchanges direction‚Äù.‚ö†Ô∏èüö®
* Changing direction is acceleration. [And special relativity cannot model acceleration!]{.fragment}
* So we cannot analyze this situation precisely and cannot make any predictions about it.
* Or can we...

## The paradox (resolution)

* Let's take this as far as special relativity will let us.
* Let $P$ be Alice‚Äôs turnaround point, at location $x=L$ in the Earth‚Äôs frame (the Earth itself is at $x=0$).
* Suppose Alice travels towards $P$ with velocity $+v$, then turns around instantly and heads back towards Earth with velocity $-v$.
* What happens at $P$?

## The paradox (resolution)

* While traveling towards $P$, Earth is the leading clock, and so its clock lags behind $P$.
* Since Alice was in sync with Earth when she left, she must perceive $P$‚Äôs clock reading far into the future (by $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$).
* She arrives at $P$ and _instantly_ turns around.
	* This is the one part of this we cannot actually model.
	* Not only is instant turnaround (infinite acceleration) impossible, but special relativity cannot handle any acceleration at all.

## The paradox (resolution)

* As she instantly turns around at $P$, no time passes on her clock or $P$‚Äôs clock.
* But now $P$ is at the front ‚Äî so¬†its clock lags behind Earth‚Äôs!
* Before the turnaround, Alice saw the time at $P$ as $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$ _ahead_ of Earth.
* After the turnaround, Alice sees the time at $P$ as $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$ _behind_ of Earth.
* And $P$‚Äôs clock didn't advance at all.
* In that moment, time on Earth advanced by $\frac{2Lv}{c^2}$!

## The paradox (quantitative)

* To Ernie, Alice‚Äôs whole trip took her $\frac{2L}{v}$.
* So Earnie thinks he ages $\frac{2L}{v}$ during her trip.
* Her time is dilated to him, so he sees her age $\frac{2L}{\gamma v}$.
	* As does she, as from her perspective her trip has length $\frac{2L}{\gamma}$ and her speed is $v$.
* The only remaining piece: [When she gets back, how much does she think he has aged?]{.fragment}
	* It had better be $\frac{2L}{v}$! (And not $\frac{2L}{\gamma^2 v}$.)

## The paradox (quantitative)

* On each leg of her trip, Alice says she traveled for $\frac{2L}{\gamma v}$.
* Meanwhile, Ernie‚Äôs clock is dilated, so on each leg of her trip she sees him age $\frac{2L}{\gamma^2 v}$.
* And at the turnaround, she sees him age an additional $\frac{2Lv}{c^2}$.
* So in total she observes him age $\frac{2L}{\gamma^2 v}+\frac{2Lv}{c^2}=\frac{2L}{v}(\frac{1}{\gamma^2}+\frac{v^2}{c^2})=\frac{2L}{v}$!

## The paradox (quantitative)

* And so indeed, Alice sees Ernie age $\frac{2L}{v}$, just as she should.
* No paradox ‚Äî she is younger, he is older.
