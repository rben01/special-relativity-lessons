# Recap

## Basic findings

* $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$.
* Moving clocks run slow by a factor of $\gamma$.
* Moving objects are contracted by a factor of $\gamma$.
* Leading clocks lag by $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$.
* Velocities add according to $u=\frac{u'+v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$ (or $\beta_u=\frac{\beta_{u'}+\beta_v}{1+\beta_{u'}\beta_v}$)

## The Lorentz transform

* This can be encapsulated in the Lorentz transform (with $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$).

# Invariants

## Things we don't agree on

* Space
* Time
* Simultaneity
	* Including a “happens-before” relationship — given two clocks $A$ and $B$ separated by some distance, a person traveling from $A$ to $B$ says $B$ is behind $A$, while a person traveling from $B$ to $A$ says $A$ is behind $B$.

## Things we do agree on?

* Obviously, the speed of light.
* Anything else?

## Intervals

* Forget about relativity for a second. [Suppose it's March, before you've taken this course.]{.fragment}
* I ask you: given two events on Earth, what about those events can _any_ two people agree on?
	* Note: they don't necessarily have the same spatial or temporal coordinate systems.
* Answer:
	* The time between the events.
   * The distance between the events.

## Distance

* Distance is particularly interesting because space is 3D, so the observers can disagree on the $x$, $y$, and $z$ distances between the two events.
* For instance:
* Alice might say the events took place at positions $(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(1,2,3)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(2,6,11)$.
	* And says the distance between them is (Pythagorean theorem) $\sqrt{(2-1)^2+(6-2)^2+(11-3)^2}=\sqrt{81}=9$.

## Distance

* Bob might say the events took place at positions $(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(7,4,5)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(3,8,-2)$.
	* And says the distance between them is $\sqrt{(3-7)^2+(8-4)^2+(-2-5)^2}=\sqrt{81}=9$.
* Regardless of his particular coordinate system, Bob could not say the events happened at, say, $(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(0,0,0)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(1,1,1)$, because his distance wouldn't agree with Alice’s.

## Spacetime intervals

* Back to relativity...
* We know that Alice and Bob will not necessarily agree on either the time _or_ the distance between the events.
* Is there something they can agree on?
* Yes: spacetime intervals.

## Spacetime intervals

* Definition: the _spacetime interval_ between two events $(x_1,t_1)$ and $(x_2,t_2)$ (in some inertial reference frame) is given by $(\Delta s)^2=(c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2$.
	* Where $\Delta t=t_2-t_1$ and $\Delta x=x_2-x_1$.
	* Definitely _not_ the Pythagorean theorem, because we're subtracting squares instead of adding.
	* Note: we will never take the square root of this quantity, we'll just leave it as $(\Delta s)^2$. [(The RHS could be negative, and then we'd need imaginary numbers.)]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
Highlight that depending on the author, the sign of the spacetime interval is flipped.

You might find the name “spacetime interval” funny because this has units of length^2, in particular there is no time at all in this expression. That's because light has been used to convert time into space.

## Spacetime intervals

* Q: A photon travels between two events. What is the corresponding spacetime interval?
* Q: A massive object travels between two events. Is the corresponding spacetime interval positive or negative?
* Q: Two events are such that even a photon is not fast enough to travel between them. Is the corresponding spacetime interval positive or negative?

## Spacetime intervals

* Now, we will actually prove the claim that the spacetime interval between two events is an invariant: something all observers can agree on.
* The goal: to show that $(\Delta s')^2=(\Delta s)^2$, i.e. $(c\Delta t')^2-(\Delta x')^2=(c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2$, for arbitrary inertial frames.

## The Lorentz transform

* Suppose we have two events, recorded as $(x_1,t_1)$ and $(x_2,t_2)$ in the unprimed frame and as $(x_1',t_1')$ and $(x_2',t_2)$ in the primed frame.
* Then $\Delta x=x_2-x_1$, $\Delta t=t_2-t_1$, $\Delta x'=x_2'-x_1'$, $\Delta t'=t_2'-t_1'$.
* Recall (Lorentz): $t'=\gamma(t-\tfrac{vx}{c^2})$ and $x'=\gamma(x-vt)$

## Boring math

* First, we show that the $\Delta$ “distributes”:

::: {.fragment}
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta t'&\class{fragment}{{}=t_2'-t_1'}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma(t_2-\tfrac{vx_2}{c^2})-\gamma(t_1-\tfrac{vx_1}{c^2})}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma((t_2-t_1)-\tfrac{v(x_2-x_1)}{c^2})}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma(\Delta t-\tfrac{v\Delta x}{c^2})}\\
\end{align*}
$$
:::

## Boring math

* Similarly, $\Delta x'=\gamma(\Delta x-v\Delta t)$.

## Boring math

* Now,

::: {.fragment}
$$
\begin{align*}
(c\Delta t')^2&\class{fragment}{{}=c^2\left(\gamma(\Delta t-\tfrac{v\Delta x}{c^2})\right)^2}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma^2\left((c\Delta t-\tfrac{v\Delta x}{c})\right)^2}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma^2(c^2(\Delta t)^2-2 v(\Delta t)(\Delta x)+\tfrac{v^2(\Delta x)^2}{c^2})}\\
\class{fragment}{(\Delta x')^2}&\class{fragment}{{}=\left(\gamma(\Delta x-v\Delta t)\right)^2}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma^2((\Delta x)^2-2v(\Delta x)(\Delta t)+v^2(\Delta t)^2)}\\
\end{align*}
$$
:::

## Boring math

* Subtract:

::: {.fragment}
$$
\begin{align*}
(c\Delta t')^2-(\Delta x')^2&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma^2\left((c^2-v^2)(\Delta t)^2+\left(\tfrac{v^2}{c^2}-1\right)(\Delta x)^2\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\gamma^2\left(c^2(1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2})(\Delta t)^2-(1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2})(\Delta x)^2\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2}}{1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2}}\left((c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=(c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2}\\
\end{align*}
$$
:::

## Result

* All observers agree on the spacetime interval between two events.
* In a sense, this is the special relativity version of our everyday notion of distance: [an interval we can all agree on despite our different coordinate systems.]{.fragment}

# Causality

## When can one event _influence_ another?

* True or false: [If event $A$ happens before event $B$ (according to some observer), then it's definitely _possible_ that $A$ might have caused $B$ to happen.]{.fragment}
* False! [Ex: If $B$ happens one second after $A$, but $A$ and $B$ are two light-seconds apart, then $A$ could not have influenced $B$, as a photon emitted from $A$ would have arrived at the location of $B$ after $B$ had happened.]{.fragment}
* Conclusion: Not everything that happens before an event $E$ can influence $E$ — it needs to have happened sufficiently close to $E$.

## Is causality relative?

* Q: Do all observers agree on causality?
* Meaning: Frame $F$ says that $A$ caused $B$, e.g. I hit a home run ($A$) and the ball broke someone’s window ($B$). [Must another frame $F'$ agree that the ball I hit broke their window,]{.fragment} [or could $F'$ think that my home run and the broken window were unrelated?]{.fragment}
* Remember: In general, $F$ and $F'$ don't even necessarily agree on the order in which events happen!
* Might it be possible that $F'$ thinks that a ball broke the window, and then, unrelated — perhaps even later! — I hit a home run?

## No!

* Let's frame this in terms of spacetime intervals.
* For one event to (maybe) have caused/influenced another, the spacetime interval must be... [nonnegative.]{.fragment}
	* Because $(\Delta s)^2=(c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2$.
	* Photons always traverse an interval of $(\Delta s)^2=0$.
	* Massive objects travel at $v<c$, which means $\Delta x<c\Delta t$, which means $(\Delta s)^2>0$.

## We can agree on causality

* But remember, everyone agrees on spacetime intervals!
* So if one observer says that $(\Delta s)^2>0$, all observers agree — and therefore there is a causal link.
* Conclusion: causality is _not_ relative — all observers agree.

## Spacetime intervals revisited

* We can classify spacetime intervals as follows:

::: {.fragment}
|       Sign       | Causal connection             | Separation terminology |
| :--------------: | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| $(\Delta s)^2>0$ | Connected by a massive object | Timelike               |
| $(\Delta s)^2=0$ | Connected by a photon         | Lightlike              |
| $(\Delta s)^2<0$ | Disconnected                  | Spacelike              |
:::

::: {.notes}
Rationale: timelike = separated more by time than by space (close enough for causal link). Spacelike = separated more by space than by time (too far for causal link).
:::

## Spacetime diagrams

* Note: causality is a stronger condition than happens-before. [Just because something happens in the future does not mean it happens in the _causal_ future.]{.fragment}
* Just because $A$ occurs before $B$ does not mean $A$ may have caused $B$.
* How does this appear on our good friend, the spacetime diagram?

## Light cones

## Light cones

* Relative to a given event $E$, all other events can be one of five types, based on where they fall relative to the light cone:

## Spacetime diagrams

1. _On_ the future light cone: a photon sent from $E$ could affect this event.
1. _Inside_ the future light cone: a massive object sent from $E$ could affect this event.
1. _On_ the past light cone: a photon sent from this event could affect $E$.
1. _Inside_ the past light cone: a massive object sent from this event could affect $E$.
1. _Outside_ either light cone: events that can neither affect nor be affected by $E$.


## The relativity of simultaneity

* Recall that in the “relativity of simultaneity” experiment, a photon was sent from the middle of the train to the clocks at either end of the train.
* In the train’s own frame, the clocks are separated by $\Delta x=L$, and the photons strike them simultaneously [($\Delta t=0$),]{.nowrap} resulting in a negative (spacelike) spacetime interval, which all observers agree on.
* Therefore, the events of the photons striking the clocks cannot be causally related — neither is in the other’s causal future!

## The relativity of simultaneity

* This is the only way it is possible for observers to disagree on the order in which the photons strike the two clocks.
	* A person on the train says the photons reach the front clock and back clock simultaneously.
	* A person moving in one direction observes the photon reach the back clock before the front clock.
	* A person moving in the other direction observes the photon reach the front clock before the back clock.

## The relativity of simultaneity

* All three are possible precisely because the spacetime interval is negative — in the train’s frame, and therefore in every frame.
* Compare to the example of my home run breaking the window — [evidently, the breaking of the window was in the causal future of my hitting the baseball, which all observers agree on.]{.fragment}
	* The spacetime interval was positive (it was traversed by a massive object), [so _all_ observers say I hit the ball before the window broke.]{.fragment}

## Special topic: causality and gravity

* Suppose that the Sun simply vanished. [How long would it take for the Earth to notice?]{.fragment}
* Newton’s equation for the force of gravity between two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $r$:

  ::: {.fragment}
  $$
  F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
  $$
  :::

* Meaning: the force is proportional to each mass in question and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

## Special topic: causality and gravity

* Once the Sun is plucked out of the sky, the spot where it used to be will have zero mass.
* And so (according to Newton) the gravitational force on the Earth would drop to zero _immediately_.
* This is less time than it takes the Sun’s light to reach us (roughly eight minutes), violating causality — [we would have been informed of the Sun’s disappearance before its photons reached us.]{.fragment}
* In particular, as the spacetime interval is spacelike, an observer might see us careen off into space _before_ they see the Sun disappear — impossible!

## Special topic: causality and gravity

* Einstein realized that this was a significant flaw in Newton’s theory of gravity, and developed general relativity in part to fix it.
	* While Newton would have been aware that the speed of light is finite, he probably saw no reason that the speed of light should be a universal speed limit.
* In GR, changes to the gravitational field propagate (as gravitational waves) at the speed of light, preserving causality.

## Conclusion

* All observers agree on the spacetime interval between two events.
* _Therefore causality is not relative_: if one observer says one event (might have) caused another, then all observers agree.
* Two events are causally related if and only if all observers agree that the cause occurred before the effect.
* Two events are causally unrelated if and only if it's possible to observe any chronological ordering of those events.
