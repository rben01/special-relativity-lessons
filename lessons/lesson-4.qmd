# Recap

## The Lorentz factor, $\gamma$

* A clock in motion appears to... [run slow by a factor of $\gamma$.]{.fragment}
* An object in motion appears... [contracted along the direction of its length by a factor of $\gamma$.]{.fragment}
* Where $\gamma=\class{fragment}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v}{c})^2}}.}$

## Synchronization

* What is the challenge of having observers at different locations discuss their findings?

# The relativity of simultaneity

## Simultaneity

* Hopefully by now you've given up on trusting your intuition of space and time.
* So it should not come as a surprise that two observers can disagree on whether two events are simultaneous (i.e. occur at the same time)!

## Design an experiment

* Your turn: try to design an experiment where different observers would disagree on whether two events happened simultaneously or not.

## The procedure

* Place a lightbulb, initially off, in the middle of a train car of length $L$.
* Set the train in motion at speed $v$.
* Turn on the lightbulb.
* When does it arrive at the front of the train (Frank)?
* When does it arrive at the back (Beth)?

## The train perspective

* Let's add a third observer, Larry, at the center of the train, who controls the lightbulb.
* Frank’s, Beth’s, and Larry’s clocks are all synchronized.
* All three agree on the procedure:

  * When their clocks hit 0, Larry turns on the light.
  * When Frank receives a photon at the front of the train, he stops his clock.
  * When Beth receives a photon at the back of the train, she stops her clock.

## The train perspective

* They all agree: the photons each travel $\frac{L}{2}$, and so Frank’s and Beth’s clocks both read $\frac{L}{2c}$.

## The platform perspective

* Remember: all inertial frames agree on events, regardless of their relative motion.
	* A platform observer right next to Frank when he stops his clock will see it read $\frac{L}{2c}$.
	* A separate platform observer right next to Beth when she stops her clock will see it read $\frac{L}{2c}$.
* The “issue”: those two observers won't agree that Frank and Beth stop their clocks at the same time!
* Why not?

## The platform perspective

* Everyone agrees that the forward-moving and backward-moving photons have the same speed...
* but to those on the platform, the front of the train is moving _away_ from the forward-moving photon,
* and the back of the train is moving _towards_ the backward-moving photon,
* and so platform observers will see Beth stop her clock before Frank!
* Takeaway 1: Events simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in other frames!

## The platform perspective

* But if Frank’s and Beth’s clocks are ticking at the same rate (to the platform observer),
* and they both read the same value when they stop,
* and they stop at different times,
* they must not have been in sync to begin with!
* Takeaway 2: Clocks synchronized in one frame are not synchronized in other frames! [According to observers on the platform, whose clock is ahead?]{.fragment}

## Calculating the time difference

* The train has rest length $L$ and speed $v$.
* From the platform’s perspective, Frank and Beth are $\frac{L}{\gamma}$ apart.
* Larry (and the lightbulb) are located at $x=0$.

## Calculating the time difference

|         | Init. pos.     | Velocity |
|---------|:--------------:|:--------:|
| Frank   | $+\frac{L}{2\gamma}$ | $v$      |
| Beth    | $-\frac{L}{2\gamma}$ | $v$      |
| Frank’s photon | $0$            | $c$  |
| Beth’s photon | $0$            | $-c$  |

* We want to find the times $t_F,t_B$ when the photons reach Frank and Beth.

## Calculating the time difference

From the platform perspective, Frank and his photon (blue) collide at a later time than Beth and her photon (yellow), indicating that the photons do not arrive at the ends of the train simultaneously.

## Calculating the time difference

* Supposing we're on the platform, right next to Larry when he turns on the lightbulb, then:
* The time when Frank and his photon meet is given by [$0+ct_F=+\frac{L}{2\gamma}+vt_F$]{.fragment} [$\Rightarrow t_F=\frac{L}{2\gamma(c-v)}$.]{.fragment}
* The time when Beth and her photon meet is given by [$0-ct_B=-\frac{L}{2\gamma}+vt_B$]{.fragment} [$\Rightarrow t_B=\frac{L}{2\gamma(c+v)}$.]{.fragment}

::: {.notes}
Good, since c+v > c-v, Beth’s time is smaller than Frank’s which matches our prediction that she would stop her clock first from our perspective.
:::

## Calculating the time difference

* The amount of time that the platform observes elapse between Beth stopping her clock and Frank stopping his clock is:

::: {.fragment}
$$
\begin{align*}
t_F-t_B&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{2\gamma(c-v)}-\frac{L}{2\gamma(c+v)}}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{1}{c-v}-\frac{1}{c+v}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{(c+v)-(c-v)}{(c-v)(c+v)}\right)}
\end{align*}
$$
:::

## Calculating the time difference

$$
\begin{align*}
t_F-t_B&=\frac{L}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{(c+v)-(c-v)}{(c-v)(c+v)}\right)\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{2v}{c^2-v^2}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{\gamma c^2}\left(\frac{v}{1-(v/c)^2}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{\gamma c^2}\left(v\gamma^2\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{Lv\gamma}{c^2}}
\end{align*}
$$


## Calculating the time difference

$$
\begin{align*}
t_F-t_B&=\frac{Lv\gamma}{c^2}
\end{align*}
$$

* This is how much time elapsed _according to us (on the platform)_.
* Frank and Beth are in motion, so their clocks are running slow by a factor of $\gamma$.
* So if $\frac{Lv\gamma}{c^2}$ time passes on _our_ clocks between Beth and Frank stopping their clocks...
* Then $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$ time passes on the train clocks.

## Conclusion

* But remember — both clocks show the same time ($\frac{L}{2c}$) when the photons arrive.
* Frank’s clock must have started out $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$ _behind_ Beth’s clock!
* Clocks separated by a distance $L$ and traveling at speed $v$, [and synchronized in their own frame,]{.fragment} [appear to differ by $\frac{Lv}{c^2}$,]{.fragment} [with the clock in front lagging behind the clock in the back — “leading clocks lag”.]{.fragment}

## Where we stand

* When an object is in motion relative to us...
* Its clocks run slow.
* Its length is shorter (in the direction of motion).
* Clocks at the front lag behind clocks at the rear.

## Exercise (5–10 min)

* A rocket ship of (rest) length $L$ is traveling at speed $+v$ (to the right). In its frame, its clocks are in sync.
* At $t=0$, its rear clock is next to us (at $x=0$), also reading $t'_\textrm{rear}=0$.
* When its front clock reads $t'_\textrm{front}=0$, a photon is emitted towards us (traveling left) from the front of the rocket ship.
* When will the photon reach us?
* Answer: $\frac{L}{c}\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$ (but you have to prove it!)

## Solution 1 (our perspective)

* At our $t=0$, the front clock reads $-\frac{Lv}{c^2}$.
* It will read time $t'=0$ at our time $t_\textrm{emit}=L\gamma\frac{v}{c^2}$ (remember, its time is dilated).
* At that moment, it will have traveled $L\gamma\frac{v^2}{c^2}$.
* The front’s initial position in our frame was $\frac{L}{\gamma}$, so its position when it emits the photon is $x_\textrm{emit}=\frac{L}{\gamma}+L\gamma\frac{v^2}{c^2}$.
* Let's simplify:

## Solution 1 (our perspective)

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{L}{\gamma}+L\gamma\frac{v^2}{c^2}&\class{fragment}{{}=L\gamma\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2}+\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=L\gamma\left(\left(1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2}\right)+\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=L\gamma}
\end{align*}
$$


## Solution 1 (our perspective)

* The photon will traverse this distance in time $t_\textrm{photon}=\frac{x_\textrm{emit}}{c}=\frac{L\gamma}{c}$.
* The total time is

::: {.fragment}
$$
\begin{align*}
t_\textrm{emit}+t_\textrm{photon}&=\frac{L\gamma v}{c^2}+\frac{L\gamma}{c}\\
&=\frac{L\gamma}{c}\left(\frac{v}{c}+1\right)
\end{align*}
$$

* Simplifying...
:::

## Solution 1 (our perspective)

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{L\gamma}{c}\left(\frac{v}{c}+1\right)&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{c}\left(\frac{1+v/c}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{c}\left(\frac{\left(\sqrt{1+v/c}\right)^2}{\left(\sqrt{1-v/c}\right)\left(\sqrt{1+v/c}\right)}\right)}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{c}\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}}
\end{align*}
$$

## Solution 2 (ship perspective)

* Now the ship’s clocks are in sync, both reading $0$. It sends the photon immediately!

::: {.fragment}
|         | Init. pos.     | Velocity |
|---------|:--------------:|:--------:|
| Photon   | $L$ | $-c$      |
| Us    | $0$ | $-v$      |

:::

* $L-ct=0-vt\Rightarrow t=\frac{L}{c-v}$

## Solution 2 (ship perspective)

* And since our time appears dilated to those on the ship, our clock will read $t'=\frac{t}{\gamma}=\frac{L}{\gamma(c-v)}$.
* (Note how we've become the primed frame.)
* Does this match what we got above?

## Solution 2 (ship perspective)

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{L}{\gamma(c-v)}&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}{(c-v)}}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L\sqrt{(1-v/c)(1+v/c)}}{c(1-v/c)}}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L\sqrt{1+v/c}}{c\sqrt{1-v/c}}}\\
&\class{fragment}{{}=\frac{L}{c}\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}}
\end{align*}
$$

## Final notes

* Unsurprisingly, we got the same result both ways.
* Because even though different frames disagree on measurements of space and time, [the question was about an event: the time on our clock when the photon reached us.]{.fragment}
* And everyone always agrees on events!

## Next up

* A way to make this easier — plug and chug.
